# Syllabus

This is the syllabus for the introduction to github @ElDragonRojo will be presenting at Appsterdam Centraal on 2013-July-17 at 17:30-19:00

## Agenda

Our goals, as always:

1. Entertain
2. Educate
3. Inspire

### :00 - :10 _The problem of Appsterdam_

_Goal:_ to introduce the minimum amount of information and jargon to understand the video.

This video is intended for an intelligent, but non-technical audience, and does not need a lot of introduction in order to understand his points. However, we do need some introduction to the background of Appsterdam so that viewers will make the link between what we are showing them and how that applies to the problems we are coming together to solve.

Present the information they need to know about Appsterdam using a structure similar to the information presented in the video. If we phrase an open question in the same for as a clear answer in the video, people will naturally associate the answer on the screen with the question we've planted in their mind, thereby coming to the desired conclusions before we make it explicit after the video.


### :10 - :30 _TED video about the power github_

_Goal:_ to show the suitability of git and github as tools to manage a complex information system.

__Clay Shirky__ [How the Internet will (one day) transform government](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bQoHIvtnTg)

Clay Shirky gave a presentation at TED in Edinborough that sums up, in 18 minutes and 33 seconds, the problem of managing large, conflicting information system, and the evolution of our toolchain for dealing with it. In plain language intended for a non-technical audience, he shows how every invention from the telegraph to the printing press have tried bad failed to peaceful knowledge exchange.

Shirky's conclusion, which ultimately inspired Open Appsterdam, is that github is the natural evolution of that toolchain, demonstrating how the git workflow and the github collaboration model are well suited for even the most complex of information management systems, using the problem of legislation as the ultimate example.


### :30 - :35 _Introducing Open Appsterdam_

_Goal:_ Understanding how git and github map to Appsterdam.

As a transition to the instructional phase, explain how the concepts expressed in Clay's video map to the problem of running Appsterdam in an open, colaborative way. Hopefully this will be an explicit statement of conclusions we have all come to by using the information in the video to resolve the problems in the introduction.

* Explain how github is a step up from the other tools being used by volunteers, including:
  * busienss tools like Basecamp 
  * document-based tools like Dropbox, 
  * cloud-based solutions between like Google Docs and iWork.com.
* Show that these tools enable better workflows, rather than being a burden, by making clear that Github is:
  * free, trustyworthy, and well-suited to the problem
  * part of programmer culture, and knowing it is a way in to that culture 
  * useful for lots of things, and a genuinely useful thing to be experienced with
* Stress the simplicity and intuitive nature of these tools
  * How the parts map well to the problems
  * How the website and its editors are easy to use
  * How markdown and other features like automatic image uploading make it easy to express yourself


### :35 - :60 _Getting Started_

_Goal:_ Learning the github workflow and toolchain in a way that introducing concepts in order of complexity and usefulness while constantly relating to use cases as Appsterdammers are likely to use them.
