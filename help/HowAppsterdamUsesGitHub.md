# Syllabus

This is the syllabus for the introduction to github @ElDragonRojo will be presenting at Appsterdam Centraal on 2013-July-17 at 17:30-19:00

## Agenda

Our goals, as always:

1. Entertain
2. Educate
3. Inspire

### :00 - :10 _The problem of Appsterdam_

_Goal:_ to introduce the minimum amount of information and jargon to understand the video.

This video is intended for an intelligent, but non-technical audience, and does not need a lot of introduction in order to understand his points. However, we do need some introduction to the background of Appsterdam so that viewers will make the link between what we are showing them and how that applies to the problems we are coming together to solve.

Present the information they need to know about Appsterdam using a structure similar to the information presented in the video. If we phrase an open question in the same for as a clear answer in the video, people will naturally associate the answer on the screen with the question we've planted in their mind, thereby coming to the desired conclusions before we make it explicit after the video.


### :10 - :30 _TED video about the power github_

_Goal:_ to show the suitability of git and github as tools to manage a complex information system.

__Clay Shirky__ [How the Internet will (one day) transform government](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bQoHIvtnTg)

Clay Shirky gave a presentation at TED in Edinborough that sums up, in 18 minutes and 33 seconds, the problem of managing large, conflicting information system, and the evolution of our toolchain for dealing with it. In plain language intended for a non-technical audience, he shows how every invention from the telegraph to the printing press have tried bad failed to peaceful knowledge exchange.

Shirky's conclusion, which ultimately inspired Open Appsterdam, is that github is the natural evolution of that toolchain, demonstrating how the git workflow and the github collaboration model are well suited for even the most complex of information management systems, using the problem of legislation as the ultimate example.


### :30 - :35 _Introducing Open Appsterdam_

_Goal:_ Understanding how git and github map to Appsterdam.

As a transition to the instructional phase, explain how the concepts expressed in Clay's video map to the problem of running Appsterdam in an open, colaborative way. Hopefully this will be an explicit statement of conclusions we have all come to by using the information in the video to resolve the problems in the introduction.

* Explain how github is a step up from the other tools being used by volunteers, including:
  * busienss tools like Basecamp 
  * document-based tools like Dropbox, 
  * cloud-based solutions between like Google Docs and iWork.com.
* Show that these tools enable better workflows, rather than being a burden, by making clear that Github is:
  * free, trustyworthy, and well-suited to the problem
  * part of programmer culture, and knowing it is a way in to that culture 
  * useful for lots of things, and a genuinely useful thing to be experienced with
* Stress the simplicity and intuitive nature of these tools
  * How the parts map well to the problems
  * How the website and its editors are easy to use
  * How markdown and other features like automatic image uploading make it easy to express yourself


### :35 - :60 _Getting Started_

_Goal:_ Learning the github workflow and toolchain in a way that introducing concepts in order of complexity and usefulness while constantly relating to use cases as Appsterdammers are likely to use them.

  * Relationship to repository
  * As an open repository
* __:45__ Markdown and Editing

  * Formatting
  * Lists
  * To-do lists
  * Links
  * Wikilinks
* __:50__ Repository for canonical resources
  * Change tracking and auditing
  * Versioning, Branching, Diffing and Merging
  * Durable Resources _text and non-text_
  * Pull requests
* __:55__ Clients and beyond
  * Clients and Editors
  * Cloning, Forking, Branching, Merging
  * Additional training resources

__Demos should be pre-recorded in order to insure against network outages, and to make it easy to share them here.__

#### Case Study _Our Website_

People start to build something, but then they have to do other things. When new people come along, they end up starting over again. It's a project that never gets completed. Lots of people want to help, but end up getting referred to some meeting or committee, or some person is not available, or no longer involved.

Now, when somebody wants something out of the website, they can file an issue. Other people can comment on that issue, and those who care can start creating a series of documents on the wiki. Through an interconnected web of conversations via the issue tracker, and collaborations via the wiki, people can coordinate on moving forward on this problem. 

Most pages can be crafted using [github's jekyll support](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/). Custom HTML, ruby, or other code can be stored in a repository, as usual. Documentation can be written in the wiki, canonized in the repository, and published via jekyll.

People who want to fix the website can do so, and people can talk about how to do so, and anyone coming along later can benefit from all of that information exchange, and pick up the project right where the last person left off.

If two people disagree, they can fork the code, craft their own visions, and present them both to the people and the peopel running Appsterdam.

Notably, for a lot of App Makers, github will end up replacing what you wanted an Appsterdam website for anyway.


### :60 - :90 _Questions and Answers_

_Goal:_ Address people's concerns and unsureties, and make sure everyone is on the same page.

As questions are likely to address things that are missing or unclear from the rest of the narrative, their answers should be added to the record here, as they are likely to be useful in general.
