# Tips for using GitHub

## Filing issues

### Rule 1: _Can it be closed?_

Try to make sure issues can be closed.
Can this work?
For example, opening an issue for coordinating the opening of A Lab on Monday is very valid.

### Rule 2: _Can it be assigned?_

Issues are most effective if they can be assigned to someone responsible.

So when rule one is applied, you should be able to open an issue for _a task (such as coordinating the A Lab door manager)_ and assign it to whoever is expected to do this.

This also makes it easier to swap responsible people, notify them, give them the option to un-assign themselves and keep track of tasks which have no responsible person.

### Rule 3: _Reference issues_

The issue tracker allows you to reference issues. So it's good to have one master ticket like this one for the week of A Lab key coordination, and then create sub tickets which reference the main ticket. Referencing is as easy as typing a `#` and then the issue number. When using the web interface, it will autocomplete for you.

### Rule 4: _Use GitHub usernames_

Mentioning people by their GitHub username will notify them via email. And next to that, it's pretty much the same reason why you should use `@username` conventions on Twitter.

## Getting notified of issues

Notifications are powered by the watch button


Notifications are powered by the repositories you are watching. If you are watching a repository, you will receive notifications for all discussions.

* Issues and their comments
* Pull Requests and their comments
* Comments on any commits

If you are not watching a repository, you'll only be notified for discussions for which you participate.

* @mentions
* Assignments
* Commits you author or commit
* Any discussion you've commented on

You're automatically watching a bunch of repositories based on your permissions â€” it's probably a good idea to go through and unwatch repositories you're not interested in.
