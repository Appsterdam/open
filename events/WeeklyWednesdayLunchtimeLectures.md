# Appsterdam Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures

## Intro

The Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures (WWLL) is an event aimed to spread knowledge between Appsterdammers, while giving an opportunity to speakers to share what they know, improve their presentation skills and be prepared to talk at conferences around the world.

## Description

The WWLL take place every week on Wednesdays around lunch time. Doors open at 12:30, when people start coming in and have lunch together while they get to know each other. At 13:00 the lecture starts. The lecture duration is usually between 20 minutes and one hour. After that the attendees get some more time to discuss freely until doors close at 14:30.

## Subjects allowed at the WWLL

Appsterdam definition of App Makers is broad and includes all the diverse set of people that work on creating apps: developers, designers, marketeers, lawyers and everyone that has something to do with apps. The subjects of the WWLL mirror this definition, so any topic regarding app making is accepted to be presented at WWLL. The WWLL, though, is not a stage to just advertise your company or product. The content of the lecture must teach something valuable to the audience.

## Facilities

The WWLL are currently held at Glimworm IT offices, located at Eerste Weteringplantsoen 8, 1017 SK, Amsterdam. Glimworm offers the space free of charge to Appsterdam every week as a service to the community. The space is equipped with a projector, a screen and chairs. Glimworm also provides two loafs of bread, two bottles of sodas, plastic plates, cups and cuttlery to facilitate lunch. The toppings for the lunch are brought by the attendees.

## Benefits

The WWLL offer benefits for both speakers and attendees.

Speakers get a stage where they can present their discoveries, teaching everybody in the community. They benefit from practicing in front of a real audience and this helps Appsterdam to compile a list of speakers that can be contacted when conferences, universities, schools and journalists around the world need someone to talk about topics related to app making.

The attendees, on the other hand, get to learn something valuable every week so they can improve their skills, products and businesses. The WWLL is also a good place to network and to meet new people and a good entry point for people new to our organization. Many people get in contact with Appsterdam for the first time through the WWLL.

## Preparation and Setup of the room

The organizer needs to be at the venue around 12:00 to meet the speaker, set up the venue and make sure that everything works properly for the presentation.

Specifically, at the Glimworm’s office this consist in the following setup procedure:

- remove the big TV screen, computer and other things from the big table in the room
- remove the red chairs around the big table
- move the big table in front of the door (it requires two people to be moved since it’s big and very heavy)
- move the small table where the big table was and set up the projector on it
- put the chairs around it for the attendees
- put food, plates and drinks on the big table. Bread, drinks, plates, cups, napkins and cutlery are provided every week by Glimworm. Usually one of their employees checks what is missing and goes to buy them. We store the remaining food in a box which is kept on the back of the room (behind the presenting screen), to be reused when possible and not thrown away. There is also a box in the fridge on the first floor, with the Appsterdam label on it, to store quickly perishable food.

When the lecture ends, the room needs to be cleaned and all these points need to be done in reverse.

### Announcements at the beginning of the lecture

Before the lecture starts, an introduction needs to be made by the organizer. It’s usually made of these points:

- welcome people and thank the host
- explain what the purpose of the WWLL is and make clear to the attendees that anybody can propose a lecture and be scheduled, by writing an email to speakers@appsterdam.rs
- present our "pay what you can afford" model: people are invited to put some pocket change in a donation bag to support Appsterdam, since we are a volunteer non profit organization. The donation is optional and it needs to be specified that everyone is free to pass the bag along if they cannot afford to donate any money at the moment or do not see the value that Appsterdam is providing yet.
- announce other coming meetups or special events and direct the people to our meetup page
- give space to any special announcement, if available
- introduce the speaker

The organizer also needs to pay attention to the duration of the lecture and after one hour has passed signal to the speaker that the time has run up.

## Costs

Since facilities are provided by the host and the toppings for lunch are brought by the attendees, there is no cost associated with the WWLL at the moment.

## Staffing

The WWLL need at least one person to be present at the lecture, set up the venue and handle the scheduling of the speakers. Since the amount of work required to organize the lectures every week is quite significant, at the moment there are three people taking care of the events: one person to organize the lectures every week (Matteo Manferdini), one volunteer to help setting up the venue (Hristo Hristov) and one volunteer to keep the schedule of the lectures and answer to the emails coming to the speakers email address (Eddy Oosterhuis).
