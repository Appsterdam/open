# Appsterdam Weekend Fun

## Intro

Although it is tempting to call Appsterdam the next Silicon Valley, it is not our goal to emulate what has come before, but to improve upon it. One of the key differences between the Appsterdam movement and other attempts to create technology centers is our support for the entire ecosystem. That means including not only App Makers, but also their families, friends, colleagues, people who are simply interested in apps, and so on.

## Description

Appsterdam Weekend Fun is our series of family-friendly events held several times a year that give App Makers a chance to network around something other than alcohol. Common events include game days, where people bring their favorite board and card games to share, picnics, walking tours, boat trips, and field trips to the city's many attractions, including NEMO, Artis Zoo, Hortus, and many more.

Together with midweek daytime lectures and nighttime drinks, Appsterdam Weekend Fun form an overall networking strategy that ensures there are social opportunities for all App Makers regardless of scheduling constraints. As opposed to other local meetups, Appsterdam events are open to everyone interested in apps, regardless of technical expertise or lack thereof.

## Benefits

There are several benefits to bringing App Makers together to foster conversations. It is fundamental to making plans for more complex initiatives. It helps people to form the personal and professional relationships necessary to build support structures for success. It also helps foster a collaborative community that eschews dehumanizing legal disputes and market disruptions.

Weekend Fun, in particular, serves to deepen the bonds between App Makers, as well as form bonds within the ecosystem. One thing that seems to be a constant in our industry is the challenge our work presents to our loved ones. These events help them form a complete support system, the way that military families do.

For families who move to Amsterdam, these events allow them to be part of what's happening here. Having an immediate support structure helps them fit in, and having contact with other people who know about things like housing and school helps them adapt.

Another secondary benefit to involving people's families is that it automatically increases the diversity of our community along gender and age lines, while making it friendly to non-technical people. This presents a friendlier, more inclusive atmosphere for all manner of newcomers.

## Costs

As a core initiative, Appsterdam Weekend Fun events are grassroots gatherings with all expenses being covered by participants on a case-by-case basis. It's one of the many free benefits Appsterdam provides that are for the community, by the community.

## Staffing

Appsterdam Weekend Fun events are planned and run by any volunteer(s) who wants to bring Appsterdammers together in a fun way!
