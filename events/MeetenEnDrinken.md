# Appsterdam Meeten en Drinken

### Wednesday · 7:00 PM · Cafe Bax

**Join us in the cozy cafe where Appsterdam was born.**

This is the place for you to meet your fellow Appsterdammers in a relaxed setting. Get to know members of the community, meet a potential business partner, bring your app to share with others, exchange ideas with like-minded people... No talks are ever scheduled and everyone is always welcome to join.

Be sure to ask the waitress/waiter about their selection of seasonal beers and grab a bite to eat from their delicious menu of daily specials. Then sit back and enjoy the company of your peers.

_The time is always Wednesday at 19:00. The place is always Café Bax._
