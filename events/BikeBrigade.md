Appsterdam Bike Brigade
===

# Purpose

The purpose of the Appsterdam Bike Brigade is to offer something for Appsterdammers to do with each other that is a bit more health oriented than meeting at bars or spending time in front of computers.

It is an opportunity to get out and see parts of the city and surrounding areas that someone might not see otherwise. It is also a chance to try riding a bike for something beyond Dutch style commuting and errands.

In an effort to help introduce new people to the wonderful world of biking-for-fun, Bike Brigade trips travel at a slower pace (usually around 15 km/hr maybe depending on who shows up for a ride) and trip distances tend to be smaller to give new riders a chance to come ride without needing a fancy bike or tons of riding experience and stamina.

# Meetings

The Appsterdam Bike Brigade rides every Sunday at 13:00. This happens regardless of weather. Riding a bike in the rain can be quite fun if you are prepared for it.

# Preparation

While Bike Brigade rides are not hardcore rides, they do require some basic preparation:

1. Each person must have a bike. Any type of bike will do so long as their bike is in good repair and ready to use.
2. Each person should bring water. Dehydration takes away from the fun of a bike ride, each person should have water to help keep this from happening.
3. Each person should have proper clothing. The speed and distance of Bike Brigade rides do not require full lycra cycling gear, plain clothes should work fine. However, a decent rain jacket will make rides in the rain much nicer and warm clothes and gloves will help when the temperature drops later in the year.
4. Each person should RSVP on the website. It helps encourage other people to come ride when they know other people are riding with them. Easiest way for anyone to know someone is coming is to RSVP on the Meetup.com event page.
