# Appsterdam Centraal
_Collaborate with your colleagues at our HQ and free workspace._


## A Lab, Workhotel.001

Appsterdam HQ is located at Overhoeksplein 2, 1031 KS, Amsterdam. This is the home of [A Lab](http://a-lab.nl), Amsterdam's hot new tech hive, located at the old Shell campus, right across the river from Centraal Station.

We have 28 seats around 4 tables in a large open space right by the front entrance of the building. 

See the [panorama pic](http://360.io/SCRLA4).


### Directions

On foot or by bike, catch the free ferry to Buiksloterweg that leaves [every 5 minutes](http://www.amsterdamsights.com/amsterdam/ferries.html) from the north (river) side of Centraal Station. A Lab is the giant, red brick building right behind the landmark Overhoeks Tower.
