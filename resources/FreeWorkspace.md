# Appsterdam Centraal
_Collaborate with your colleagues at our HQ and free workspace._


## A Lab, Workhotel.001

Appsterdam HQ is located at Overhoeksplein 2, 1031 KS, Amsterdam. This is the home of [A Lab](http://a-lab.nl), Amsterdam's hot new tech hive, located at the old Shell campus, right across the river from Centraal Station.

We have 28 seats around 4 tables in a large open space right by the front entrance of the building. 

See the [panorama pic](http://360.io/SCRLA4).


### Directions

On foot or by bike, catch the free ferry to Buiksloterweg that leaves [every 5 minutes](http://www.amsterdamsights.com/amsterdam/ferries.html) from the north (river) side of Centraal Station. A Lab is the giant, red brick building right behind the landmark Overhoeks Tower. When you get off the ferry, go left towards the EYE film institute. You will pass Cafe de Pont and Tolhuistuin. After you've crossed the little bridge, you can get to A Lab through the metal gate. If the gate is locked, just go around the corner and you'll see a door in the fence on the left side of A Lab.

See [this map](https://github.com/Appsterdam/open/blob/master/resources/maps/AppsterdamHQ.geoJSON) for ferry and HQ location.

If you are arriving by car, see below for parking information.


### Hours

Monday-Friday 09:00-18:00

Please tweet the scheduled volunteer below to gain entrance if the door is locked.
