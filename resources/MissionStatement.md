* Appsterdam Vision / Mission in 3-5 sentences
* Track record (100 WWLLs, 20 Gurus Sessions, x podcasts, X Pitch clubs, "Open For Business" initiative, etc)
* Current Organization / team?
* What we could accomplish in the next 2 years if we had funding (or other non-monetary resources). How we would organize ourselves to accomplish it? Some ideas would be: hire a central team so it's not just volunteers; pay Gurus for Guru sessions; provide innovation coaching; provide legal / residency support, etc.
