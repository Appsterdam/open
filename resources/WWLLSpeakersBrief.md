# Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures Speakers Brief

Thanks for your enthusiasm to share your knowledge with the Appsterdam community! To help you prepare the session smoothly, we’ve prepared this speaker brief.

## Purpose and Spirit

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures (WWLL in short) is a program that allows Appsterdammers to share knowledge with the community. In exchange, speakers receive individual speaker training and, if the reception from the audience is 80% positive, you become part of the official Appsterdam Speakers Bureau. We refer to the Bureau when conferences, universities, journalists, or other venues ask us for high quality speakers. Participants of WWLL have already spoken at major events.

If the reception from the audience does not reach 80% approval, it does not mean you are excluded from the Bureau forever. You have as many opportunities as you want to improve your skills until you make it to the list.

## Lecture Topics

Speakers are encouraged to talk about any subject related to App Making. This covers a wide variety of topics: software development, computer languages, product engineering, design, marketing, social media, hardware, web, etc., even legal topics such as intellectual property, trademarking, etc. Cross pollination from other fields, such as healthcare, architecture, NGOs and others are welcome too, as long as it’s somehow related to App Making.

Repeat topics from previous lectures are welcome. We believe in giving everyone a chance to express different views, methods, and experiences on recurring themes. Please note that the WWLL are not meant as an opportunity to just advertise your product or company; they are intended to be a forum for knowledge exchange.


## Scheduling

Scheduling for a lecture is done according to availability on a first come, first serve basis by the Speakers Bureau Coordinators: Matteo Manferdini (matteo@appsterdam.rs) and Eddy Oosterhuis (eddy@appsterdam.rs). If you need to reschedule your lecture, or have questions about the program, please contact them.


## Speaker Training

Are you a new speaker? Has it been a while since your last presentation? Have no fear, the Speakers Bureau will provide you with speaker training. A good starting point is this video by Appsterdam Mayor, Mike Lee. This is a presentation about presenting, aptly titled, ["The Meta Presentation."](http://youtu.be/6Jidkf7RggU)

Next, we offer free, individual speaker training to all WWLL speakers. We prefer to schedule training at least a week in advance of your presentation. The training is not a requirement but we encourage those with limited or no experience to schedule at least one session.  The trainings help us to raise the quality of speakers in our community.

For the training, you will present your completed presentation (or whatever you have ready at that point) on your own laptop. During your presentation, the Appsterdam Speakers Bureau coordinators will time you and take notes. Afterwards, they will review your strong points and where you need improvement. It is highly advised that you take notes at that time. Should you need or want to schedule another training session, please let us know.

Additional training is also available through our Appsterdam Monthly Speaker Training Meeting, held the last Monday of each month. Be sure to RSVP since seats are limited due to time constraints.

## Speaker and Lecture Info

After scheduling your lecture, please send the following info to Matteo and Eddy: 

- Title of the presentation
- A brief abstract (a couple of sentences will do)
- Your contact info: full name, company, website, email address, phone number, Twitter handle.

Please provide all the information at least two weeks in advance or your lecture will be cancelled.

## Venue and Setup

The WWLL are currently held at the office of our generous host, Glimworm, located next to Weteringcircuit on Eerste Weteringplantsoen 8, 1017 SK, Amsterdam. The venue is easily accessible via trams 4, 7, 10, 16, 24, 25.

A beamer is available at the venue to project your slides. Lunch is provided by the host and attendees: the host provides bread and drinks, while attendees bring their favorite broodje toppings.

Please arrive at the venue at 12:00 for set up and to work out any technical issues before the doors open at 12:30. 

You are expected to bring your own laptop, clicker for advancing your slides, and the necessary connector for the beamer, if needed, which has a standard VGA port. We can lend you a clicker or adapter, but we feel it’s the duty of a good speaker to be prepared with all of her/his own materials. 

## Presentation

Attendance is usually around 20 to 30 people, depending on topic and weather conditions (we are in the Netherlands, after all).

Presentation will start at 13:00 and you will have up to one hour, including Q&A if you plan to do it. Length of the presentation may vary, but we require you to have at least a 20 minutes speech so to make it worth it for people to attend.

Your presentation will be video recorded to be released to the public later. We will do this only with your explicit consent and by providing you the appropriate waiver, either at the time of the presentation or when some time prior to releasing the video.

At the end of the presentation you will be asked by the people in charge of the recording for a version of your slides in their original format and in PDF format. Having them ready will speed up the process.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask!
