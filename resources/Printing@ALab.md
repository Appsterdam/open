## Instructions for hooking your computer up to the printer at A Lab.

If you're on a PC, you should be able to find the printer automatically when you go to print. In your print preferences, be sure to choose B&W as default (saves us money and we imagine most people only need B&W). In the job log, enter the 6-digit code as the user code.

If you're on a Mac running OS X 10.7 and higher, the driver will be found automatically. If you're running OS X 10.6 or lower, you will have to download the driver, found [here](http://support.ricoh.com/bb/html/dr_ut_e/re/model/mp2500/mp2500en.htm). The printer model is Ricoh Aficio MP 2500. Choose the OS you're running. Download and install the driver.

Open System Preferences. Go to Print & Fax. Add a new printer by clicking on the little plus button on the left side, under the other printers you might already have in your system.

Click on IP. Enter the address as shown. For 'Print Using:,' select 'Auto Select' and it should find the driver you just downloaded. Click 'Add.'

Go to a document and proceed as if you're printing it. Under 'Printer Features,' select Black and White in Color Mode. Above, that, choose A4 as the standard size. At the top, save this as a new 'Preset' and name it whatever you want.

Now go to 'Job Log,' select 'Enable User Code,' and enter the 6-digit code as shown:

Click on 'Print' and see if the page came out. If it didn't, ask Anne for help.
